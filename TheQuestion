ANSWER TO THE QUESTION

As the player explores the map, all items within the agents 'view' are
 saved as in a hashtable that uses map coordinates as keys. 

The program uses a breadth first search to search the map for gold and
other useable items. It will check for possible future states in
 order of highest ot lowest priority. These states, in the order their
 tested in, are:

1.	CHECK Are we currently holding gold?

	TRUE  Go back to where we started

	FALSE Make the next check


2. 	CHECK Is gold reachable using tools we have or can acquire 
	 on our journey to the gold? (If gold is not on the current map the check will return false)

	TRUE Go to the gold and acquire it

	FALSE Go to the next check


3.  CHECK Is the axe reachable?

	TRUE Aquire the axe

	FALSE Go to the next check  

4. 	CHECK Is the dynamite reachable? (this check includes the 
	 use of axes and boats to get the dynamite)

	TRUE Undergo moves ot aquire the gold

	FALSE Go to the next check
 

5.	CHECK Is the map explored? (has the agent visited every
 	 point on the map that it can visit without the use of tools)

 	TRUE Go to the next check

 	FALSE Go to the closest place that is unexplored

6.	CHECK Do we have the axe? (if nothing else can be accomplished with
 	 current map, either blow some walls up to get the axe or cut some
 	 trees down using the axe)

 	TRUE cut down the closest tree on the map

 	FALSE go to next check

7.	CHECK Is axe reachable using dynamite?

	TRUE Acquire the axe and sacrifice dynamite (Sometimes trees 
	 need to be cut down to explore the area with the gold)

	FALSE go to next check
